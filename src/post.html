            <p class="post-description">
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to
                the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h2 class="post-header">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p class="post-description">
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to
                create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="post-header">How I got started</h2>
            <p class="post-description">
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also
                write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                helping others learn and stay motivated.
